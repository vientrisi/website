        <!--<p>As I have always been artistically inclined, I would like to be able to use the skills in digital and traditional
        art that I've worked on in the future. An ideal career path for me would be storyboarding and/or character design as it means I can use
        my knowledge from the Film Production degree and fully understand the films that I will be working on and how they are made
        and marketed.</p>

                After (hopefully) achieving my Film Production degree, I am currently looking into doing a Masters in
                Illustration to further my art skills and become considerably better before heading into the workplace.
                Ideally, I would also have been able to secure some work experience in my time at University, which will
                give me a good headstart when I am ready to look for work. -->
